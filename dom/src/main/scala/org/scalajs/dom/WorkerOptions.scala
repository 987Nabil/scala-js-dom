/** The Worker interface represents a background task that can be easily created and can send messages back to their
  * creators. Creating a worker is as simple as calling the Worker()Â constructor, specifying a script to be run in the
  * worker thread.
  *
  * Of note is the fact that workers may in turn spawn new workers as long as those workers are hosted within the same
  * origin as the parent page. In addition, workers may use XMLHttpRequest for network I/O, with the exception that the
  * responseXML and channel attributes on XMLHttpRequest always return null.
