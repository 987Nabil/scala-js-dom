Packages
========

In v1.x, there used to be sub-packages grouping some parts of the DOM API by major feature.
In v2.x, we've decided to put everything in `org.scalajs.dom` and get rid of sub-packages.

The reason for this change is that the real DOM API isn't namespaced in anyway, and the decision
whether to group in a package or not, was subjective and inconsistent.


Files
=====

* Use `package.scala` for a package object and nothing else.
  Also don't include traits/classes/objects.

* Match the filename to the trait/class/object in it; don't add multiple top-level types.
  This is effectively Java-style.


Facades
=======

If a feature has many types that don't share a common unambiguous prefix (like `crypto`),
  * firstly, please raise an issue to discuss so that you don't do work only to be asked to undo it
    during PR review
  * create a feature package
  * put all of its types in its package

If a feature has only a few types that don't share a common unambiguous prefix (like `DOMParser`),
  * create a facade for the main feature
  * create a companion object for the facade
  * put all of its types in the companion object

If a feature has types that all share a common unambiguous prefix (like `Gamepad*`),
  * put it all in `dom`


Non-Facades
===========

* Implicit conversions should go in companion objects so that they are always in scope without the
  need for imports. There's no need to group by feature, the types already specify the feature.

* Add Scala-only utilities that pertain to a specific facade, in the facades companion object
  Eg: helper constructors, legal facade values.

* We currently don't see the need for Scala-only utilities that don't pertain to a specific facade,
  or shouldn't be universally available (subjective judgement here).
  If you believe you've got a compelling use case please raise an issue first to discuss.


Partially-Supported DOM API
===========================

TODO: Pending discussion in #514


Binary Compatibility
====================

Binary compatibility for Scala.js facades is different than standard Scala.
The following are changes that are indeed incompatible in both formats:

Don't:
  * Remove a trait / class / object
  * Change a class into a trait or vice versa

Here is a non-exhaustive list of changes that would be binary incompatible for Scala classes, but
are compatible for JS facade types:

You can:
  * Remove a member
  * Change the type or signature of a member
  * Add a field in a trait
  * Add an abstract member in a trait


Submitting a PR
===============

Once you're done making your changes...

1. Run `sbt prePR`

2. Run `git diff api-reports` and ensure that you aren't breaking backwards-binary-compatibility
   (see above). The api reports are auto-generated by `prePR` and provide a concise summary of the
   entire API. Make sure to look at the top of the file for a description of format.

   Note: We might automate binary-compatibility checking in the future (See #503) but for now,
   it's just a helpful tool for reviewing PRs.

3. Check in and commit the changes to `api-reports`

4. Submit your PR

5. Know that your contribution is appreciated, thank you!
